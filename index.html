     <h1>My Favourite Dish is</h1>
     <h2>Chocolate Lava Cake dressed with Strawberry Jam</h2>
     </section>
     <section id="info">
       <p>I like the chocolate lave cake because its a really cohesive dish whose all elements go well together and there is a delicious bang and burst of different flavours. I like my Cake to be light and fluffy and usually of vanilla flavour. The cake is the main part of the dish and is really delicious on its own too. The chocolate lave part is a frozen ball of dark, milk and white chocolate ganache that melts while baking. The flavour of the ganache is really delicious and compliments the cake. The Strawberry Jam really balances every element of the dish and its delicious fruity, tangy and sweet taste takes from the creaminess of the cake and lava and is a unique, beautiful topping for the dish. The dish is overall very suitable for being placed as a comfort food and almost anybody who eats will fall in love with its taste.</p>

           <h3>My inspiration is Albert Einstein. He was one of the greatest scientists of his time. He is my inspiration because even though he fell sick very often and couldn't learn to speak for a long time, he had the ability to correctly imagine the secrets of the universe, the mysterious gravity and the properties of energy.</h3>
